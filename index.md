3. Once the installation process is complete, launch the .exe file by clicking on it.

4. A popup will show up, which will give you the option to modify any installation settings. You should be fine even if you just click next for each of the settings to go with the default setup.

5. That's it! Now you have your text editor set up!

## Establising a Remote Conenction

In CSE 15L, we have a course specific account. We will use this account and the VSCode terminal in order to establish a remote connection so that we can perform various tasks over the internet.

1. The first step is to install git.
    * Check if git is already installed on your machine by typing out `git --version` on the VSCode terminal. If git is already installed, you should get a response as shown in the image below.

    * If git is not installed, go to [https://gitforwindows.org/](https://gitforwindows.org/) and click on the download button. Follow the instructions as they appear to set up git. Once done, you can run `git --version` to confirm whether git has been installed.
